# statistics-resampling-online

Try the [statistics-resampling package](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/) online in a Notebook with an **Octave** kernel within Jupyter Lab using Binder by clicking a launch-binder button below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/master?urlpath=/lab/tree/statistics-resampling.ipynb) (default `binder` branch: master)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/jammy?urlpath=/lab/tree/statistics-resampling.ipynb) (stable `binder` branch: jammy)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/jammy-docker?urlpath=/lab/tree/statistics-resampling.ipynb) (stable `docker` branch: jammy-docker) [recommended]

Note that the first time you access a statistics-resampling-online `binder` branch (since the last commit at the GitHub repository) it may take a while to build, but frequent access to statistics-resampling-online thereon should give load times less than a minute. Binder for the stable `docker` branches loads much faster and is more stable. Data files (.tsv and .csv) can be conveniently modified using the [jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor](https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor.html) included in this environment. Other Jupyter Lab extensions included enable the real-time collaboration and the creation and editing of diagrams and Markdown documents. The environment also includes kernels to run workbooks in **Julia**, **Python** and **R** (in which additional packages and modules can be installed with Pkg, pip, or from CRAN respectively). Preferably, pre-built packages can also be installed from within code cells of a notebook by executing the system command `!conda install -qc conda-forge <package-name>`, where `<package-name>` is replaced with the name of a [conda-forge package](https://conda-forge.org/packages/).

You could consider loading Jupyter notebooks and data files from your own GitHub repositories using this Binder environment with the help of the [nbgitpuller link generator](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html?tab=binder). This Binder repository is `nbgitpuller` enabled, so you can use it's environment (and it's image if it exists already) to load content (e.g. notebooks and data) from your own GitHub repository (for an example, see [![](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-project?label=GitHub%20Repo&amp;style=social)](https://github.com/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-project/)). We recommend using one of the stable branches (e.g. jammy-docker) if you intend to use `nbgitpuller`. Alternatively, you could fork this repository or use it as a template for you own GitHub repository. 

If you wish to download and use the package offline, you can find the package source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/). The documentation for the statistics-resampling package can be found at the following link:
